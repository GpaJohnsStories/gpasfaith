DESIGN GUIDELINES:
<ol>
<li>Every page will use the same header except for index.html which will be, like gpasshop, a big photo.</li>
<li>All pages will use the same footer when we get to it.</li> 
<li>All code must be html or js unless approved by John beforehand. </li>
<li>All code must be severely documented, especially a section ot a function to assist in my understanding of it and also to easily and accurately locate code to be edited.</li> 
<li>Primary build is for 1) tablet screen, 2) mobile phone screen, 3) desktop screen.</li> 
<li>Default font size is always 16pt or 21px </li>
<li>Plain font will be lexend </li>
<li>Fun font will be kalam </li>
<li>Text font will be Georgia </li>
<li>Bible title font will be ???? -- we'll figure it out later </li>
<li>This is a website for everyone from teens to older seniors, with no advertising and strict security policy. -- I am very concerned about the real possibility of porn hackers trying to get at my story base to insert porn into it or to read comments and give porn responses. So, let's implement all enhanced security and let me know if you find any holes or weaknesses of any kind. </li>
<li>This is a website to help everyone "feel at home", comfortable, safe and NOT JUDGED. </li>
<li>This website must be very easy for older people to navigate -- Ensure all buttons are large and easy for stiff fingers to click on smart phones, tablets or any other device with a touch screen. </li>
<li>All images and content must be fully responsive for various screen sizes (tablets, phones) since children use a wide range of devices. 11) Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability for anyonr with visual impairments. </li>
<li>Ensure the navigation is extremely simple and intuitive. Large, clear buttons for all menu buttons. 13) Main menu is vertical and is to ALWAYS be available for dropdown from top of screen, not scroll. </li>
<li>There should be a "Back to Top" button on all pages. </li>
<li>All buttons throughout the public website pages are to be 3d, color same as appropriate with click action but not hover -- no hover on tablets and phones. </li>
<li>Any css class must have the class name begin with types of places it is used and a description of what is does. </li>
<li>The primary db or file key for text, audio and video records will be the 7-character TextCode assigned to the text to which they are attached. </li>
<li>We will use a co-op approach to storage... faith-text -- stories, webtext, bio's, etc. will be preformatted and stored on github as individual html files with no github processing, ready to display or print. </li>
<li>Smaller Tables such as color presets will be stored as CoPilot recommends. </li>
<li>faith-index will be stored on supabase for faster searching, sorting, filtering.</li>
<li>Error messaging - when things go wrong (404 pages, form errors), use gentle, encouraging language that maintains the "safe, not judged" atmosphere. Something like "Oops, that page went on vacation!" instead of harsh technical errors.</li>

</ol>
